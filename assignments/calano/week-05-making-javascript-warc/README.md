# Making JavaScript WARC

This presentation examines the publication "[Jawa: Web Archival in the Era of JavaScript](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi22/presentation/goel)" by [Ayush Goel](https://goelayu.github.io/), [Jingyuan Zhu](https://jingyzhu.github.io/), [Ravi Netravali](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ravian/), and [Harsha V. Madhyastha](https://harshavm.engin.umich.edu/). As JavaScript becomes an ever-increasing presence on the web, JAWA is a novel archival format which seeks to improve the accuracy and interactivity of web archives. In this presentation I describe the work and findings of the authors and their work's relation to traditional web archives and archival techniques.
