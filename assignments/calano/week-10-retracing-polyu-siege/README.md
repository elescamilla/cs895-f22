# Retracing the [Seige of Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_the_Hong_Kong_Polytechnic_University)

The Seige of Hong Kong PolyU was a pivotal moment in the overall [Hong Kong protests of 2019-2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_Hong_Kong_protests). Students clashed with the mixed forces of the Hong Kong Police Force and People's Armed Police over 13 days. The university had become a fortified stronghold for protestors as they fought for what they viewed as one of the last remaining free bastions of hope against the imposing force of the mainland Chinese government.

The event was widely covered in the media but is broad coverage enough to get an accurate picture of the events that were happening on the ground?
